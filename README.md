# port-scanner
RUSH Port Scanner is a Python-based network scanning tool designed to identify open ports on a target host. It uses asynchronous programming to perform concurrent port scans efficiently, making it suitable for quickly assessing a range of ports without excessive delays.

Usage:
To use RUSH Port Scanner, run the script from the command line with the following syntax:
python3 port_scan.py TARGET START_PORT END_PORT
Where
  TARGET: The hostname or IP address of the target system you want to scan.
  START_PORT: The starting port number for the scan.
  END_PORT: The ending port number for the scan
